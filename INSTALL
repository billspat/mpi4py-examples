# Installing Anaconda Python


# see wiki about Anaconda background

# For those who understand Python, consider using "miniconda" which is  smaller to download and comes with minimal packages


### First inspect current environment pre-install
# what is in your profile startup?
cat ~/.bashrc
# what is your current default python program?
which python


###  get anaconda python installer
# https://www.anaconda.com/download/
# Right click on the small link for Python 3.6 Linux 64bit installer
# lots of shell scripting goodies here


# let's use a temporary directory to download this large installer
mkdir ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp

# here is current URL for download, replace with the one you copied above

URL=https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

# use the curl program to download this file from this URL

curl -O $URL

### RUN INSTALLER
# can we get just the name of the program from the full URL above?
# what does basename $URL do?
# what are backticks in BASH?


INSTALLER=`basename $URL`

# run the script installer
bash $INSTALLER

# the installer changes your .bashrc

cat ~/.bashrc

# source this file to get those changes

source ~/.bashrc

# which python now?
which python
